# database
Proof of concept for a simple database program for keeping track of employee data. Purpse is to be able to easiely get a list of people 
trained in a specific position, and their contact information. Also allows for ease of adding/changing information. And to be able to add 
employee evaluations. 

Was developed with a small branch of a event staffing company in mind. As a replacement for keeping track
of everything in excel sheets. Currently everything is stored in CSV, as it was easy to use as proof
of concept. 

If continuing forward with the project would aim to have it connected to a database for
data storage. Also would look at more features such as ability to order based on a rank
for evaluations.
